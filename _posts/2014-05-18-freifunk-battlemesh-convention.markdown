Last week we went to Leipzig to attend a <a href="http://www.freifunk.net/">freifunk</a> convention called <a href="http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV7">BattleMeshV7</a>. 

Freifunk is a non-commercial NGO working on implementing WiFi mesh networks all over Europe. The goal is to have free (as in free software and in free beer) wireless infrastructure so that everyone gets unregulated access to the internet.

There are a lot of different freifunk communities all over Europe and they are all developing their own flavour of mesh protocol software for common router hardware.
They meet once a year to discuss newest software and hardware technologies, tell each other the latest stories and most important take on the battle for best mesh protocol.

This years meeting took place in Leipzigs lokal hackerspace <a href="http://www.sublab.org/">sublab</a>. They were the perfect host prepared with very friendly locals, lots of space, drinks and a fully equipped kitchen for ad-hoc cooking.
But the convention wasn't all about mesh networking. Eeach year the battlemesh takes place in a different country and the guys from the sublab made sure to show the international visitors around and intruduce them to the city of Leipzig.

Leipzig is a huge city with a lot of vacant lots. This enables people to use this space for community projects. We made a tour through the neighborhood to discover some of them.
Most interesting was a urban farm called annalinde
city farms, big property, sell food to restaurants and consumers
showed us around
want to tinker around with hydroponics and aquaponics
maybe they'll need some equipment?!

At plants & machines we love the internet and our robots do, too. Sharing our internet-access for those in need we are part of the local freifunk community called <a href="http://weimarnetz.de/">weimarnetz</a>. 
why is the internet cool
the internet enables us to do better!

The most interesting topics during the convention for us were
* olsrv2 - bandwidth based routing
* multipath routing - interesting security aspects
* 5 Ghz - weather radar

We are very happy to have had a visit, meet inspiring people and learn alot.
Thank you sublab, thank you freifunk and last but not least, thank you weimarnetz for sparking our interest.
